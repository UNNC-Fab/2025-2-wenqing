### Background of Fab Lab

Fab Lab (short for Fabrication Laboratory) is a global open-source network of digital fabrication laboratories dedicated to fostering innovation, education, and community development by providing access to advanced digital manufacturing tools (such as 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, etc.). It embodies the philosophy of “How to Make (Almost) Anything,” enabling individuals and communities to transform digital designs into physical prototypes — realizing the transition from “bits to atoms.”

#### Origin and History

The Fab Lab concept originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA). It was first proposed in 2001 by MIT professor Neil Gershenfeld during his famous course “How to Make (Almost) Anything.” The first Fab Lab was established as an experimental community outreach project in collaboration with the late social activist Mel King.

- **First Fab Lab**: Officially launched at MIT in 2002 as a joint initiative between the Grassroots Invention Group and CBA, with initial funding partly from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).
- **Global Expansion**: The first Fab Lab outside MIT was set up in 2002 at Vigyan Ashram in India, with equipment supported by NSF and IIT Kanpur. The network grew rapidly worldwide. In 2007, a group of MIT students developed the first mobile Fab Lab, bringing digital fabrication capabilities to remote and underserved regions.
- **Establishment of the Fab Foundation**: Around 2011, the Fab Foundation was created under the leadership of Gershenfeld and others to manage the global network, standardize operations, and ensure sustainability.  
  As of 2025, there are over 2,500 Fab Labs in more than 130 countries, located in universities, schools, community centers, libraries, and even corporations.

The evolution of Fab Lab has been deeply influenced by the open-source movement and the digital fabrication revolution. What began as an academic experiment at MIT has transformed into a worldwide movement emphasizing inclusivity, creativity, local problem-solving, and sustainable development.

#### Core Characteristics and Global Impact

- **Standard Equipment & Open Design**: Every official Fab Lab must be equipped with a standardized toolkit (typically valued at $50,000–$100,000), including laser cutters, 3D printers, vinyl cutters, CNC milling machines, electronics workstations, etc. These tools are based on open-source designs, making replication and knowledge-sharing easy.
- **Education & Community Focus**: Fab Labs are not just workshops — they are powerful learning platforms. Through hands-on workshops, local programs, and the distributed online Fab Academy, they teach digital fabrication skills, promote STEM education, entrepreneurship, and lifelong learning.
- **Worldwide Impact**:  
  - Rapid prototyping of medical devices (e.g., PPE and ventilators during COVID-19)  
  - Sustainable product design and circular economy projects  
  - Local innovation in agriculture, education, and art  
  - Revitalization of manufacturing in developed countries and empowerment of communities in developing regions

Fab Labs have become a cornerstone of the global Maker Movement and align closely with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and Goal 4 (Quality Education).

In short, Fab Lab is far more than a collection of machines — it is a global platform that democratizes advanced manufacturing and turns ideas into reality, anywhere in the world.
