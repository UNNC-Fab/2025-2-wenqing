The diagram clearly illustrates the core workflow of 3D printing.

### 2. Model Preview and Parameter Configuration

Model positioning, automatic support generation, and toolpath planning were performed in Bambu Studio. 

### 3. Original CAD Model

Using properly dried PLA filament, the printing process was stable, interlayer bonding excellent, surface finish fine, and snap-fit features functional without adhesive, indicating that process parameters were in the optimal range.

### 5. Failed Specimen and Defect Analysis

The same filament batch, stored for an extended period, absorbed significant moisture. This resulted in pronounced stringing, delamination, and localized warping. 
The reasons for failure:  
- Moisture evaporation formed bubbles cause inconsistent extrusion  
- Reduced first-layer adhesion causes warping  
- Insufficient interlayer cooling causes weakened bonding
